Time::Normalize version 0.09
============================

This module is no big deal.  It doesn't do anything flashy, or
revolutionary, or even difficult.  It simply provides some functions
that aid in parsing date/time values, by taking various input values
and normalizing them into standard, ready-to-use values.

This module is meant to be used as an aid for checking and
reformatting sloppy input values from dubious sources.  But it also
can be used simply to transform or reformat known-good time and date
values as well.

This module is also very handy when parsing dates and times matched
with Regexp::Common::time.

EXAMPLES

 ($y, $m, $d) = normalize_ymd (2005, 'jan', 7);
 # Returns '2005', '01', '07'.

 ($y, $m, $d, $w, $wn, $wn3, $mn, $mn3) = normalize_ymd ('05', 1, 7);
 # Returns '2005', '01', '07', 3, 'Friday', 'Fri', 'January', 'Jan'.

 ($h24, $m, $s, $h12, $am) = normalize_hms (13, 45);
 # Returns '13', '45', '00', 1, 'p'

 ($h24, $m, $s, $h12, $am) = normalize_hms (11, 45, undef, 'P.M.');
 # Returns '23', '45', '00', 11, 'p'

 ($y, $m, $d) = normalize_ymd (2005, 'February', 29);
 # Throws an error: Invalid day "29"


DEVELOPMENT STATE

This module is stable.  The interface should not change, and the test
suite is fairly complete.  I will upgrade this module's version number
to 1.0 sometime in the next few months, unless I get feature requests
or bug reports.

If you find any bugs, or if any behavior of Time::Normalize surprises
you, I would be grateful if you would send me an email message about
it.  Thanks.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install

If you do not have Module::Build, you can use the older steps:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

On Windows, if you have Activestate perl, you will need to use nmake
instead of make. If you have Strawberry perl, you will need to use dmake.

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  POSIX           (optional)
  I18N::Langinfo  (optional)
