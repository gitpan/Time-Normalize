Time::Normalize version 0.02
============================

This module is no big deal.  It doesn't do anything flashy, or
revolutionary, or even difficult.  It simply provides some functions
that aid in parsing date/time values, by taking various input values
and normalizing them into standard, ready-to-use values.

This module is meant to be used as an aid for checking and
reformatting sloppy input values from dubious sources.  But it also
can be used simply to transform or reformat known-good time and date
values as well.


EXAMPLES

 ($y, $m, $d) = normalize_ymd (2005, 'jan', 7);
 # Returns '2005', '01', '07'.

 ($y, $m, $d, $w, $wn, $wn3, $mn, $mn3) = normalize_ymd ('05', 1, 7);
 # Returns '2005', '01', '07', 3, 'Friday', 'Fri', 'January', 'Jan'.

 ($h24, $m, $s, $h12, $am) = normalize_hms (13, 45);
 # Returns '13', '45', '00', 1, 'p'

 ($h24, $m, $s, $h12, $am) = normalize_hms (11, 45, undef, 'P.M.');
 # Returns '23', '45', '00', 11, 'p'

 ($y, $m, $d) = normalize_ymd (2005, 'February', 29);
 # Throws an error: Invalid day "29"

DEVELOPMENT STATE

This is a brand-new module.  It has a decent test suite, and no known
bugs, but it has not been extensively field-tested.  So use with
caution.

If you find any bugs, or if any behavior of Time::Normalize surprises
you, I would be grateful if you would send me an email message about
it.  Thanks.
